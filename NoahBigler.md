#What I learned
I learned that there are many steps in sending data from the local machine to github, or even through git on the local machine. This process can be very time consuming, but I can see why git is used for version control with the various steps and ways to protect data, i.e. .gitignore. The the use of forking and pull-requests, the truly aid in protection of software while allowing collaboration. Before respositories like github, I wonder how open-source software was even developed. Additionally, I am curious to see how quickly open-source products have grown in number and quality since products like github have hit the scene. 

#What still confuses me
1. What is the purpose of the staging area? We have the working directory and the local repository, but why have the need for a staging area, why not take that functionality and put it into the working directory or local repo?

I have completed the introduction steps and watched the git hub crash course.
